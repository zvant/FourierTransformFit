# FourierTransformFit
## Class
### fourier.fitting.Point
two dimentional point, with coordinate in double value.

### fourier.fitting.FourierTransform
fitting and transformation. the core method read ArrayList<fourier.fitting.Point> as input and return double[] as result.

### fourier.fitting.graphic.GraphicFitting
the graphical interface
#### now
construct the main interface, load graph from an image file, draw a coordinate system over the graph, add sample points with mouse click.
#### what is next
fitting and transformation, draw the fitting curve.
